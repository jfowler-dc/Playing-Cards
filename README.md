# Playing-Cards
52 standard playing cards

## Description
> Create a simple app using ReactJS that has a deck of 52 standard playing cards.

## Tasks
> 1. The app should allow us to draw from the deck. We should be able to draw 52 cards consecutively without seeing any duplicate cards.
> 2. The app should also allow us to shuffle the cards and then draw again so that we are likely to see a differently ordered 52 cards.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# clone app files to desktop
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/jfowler-dc/Playing-Cards.git

# view files
cd Playing-Cards/cards

# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification
